# Hong Kong (HK) Nintendo eShop Support Investigation Report

## Executive Summary

After investigating the Hong Kong (HK) region support in the Nintendo eShop system, I can confirm that **Hong Kong (HK) does NOT appear in the list of active shops returned by Nintendo's official API**, despite Hong Kong having an official Nintendo eShop presence.

## Investigation Results

### 1. Nintendo API Response Analysis

**getActiveShops() Results:**
- Total active shops found: 43
- Hong Kong (HK) status: **NOT FOUND**
- Only 1 Asian region shop found: Japan (JP)

**getShopsAsia() Results:**
- Total Asia shops found: 1
- Hong Kong (HK) status: **NOT FOUND**
- Only shop returned: Japan (JP - JPY)

### 2. Regional Distribution

**Americas Region (8 shops):**
- AR (Argentina), BR (Brazil), CL (Chile), CO (Colombia), PE (Peru), CA (Canada), MX (Mexico), US (United States)

**Europe Region (34 shops):**
- All European countries including UK, Germany, France, etc.
- Notably includes AU (Australia), NZ (New Zealand), ZA (South Africa) classified as "Europe" region

**Asia Region (1 shop only):**
- JP (Japan) - Only Asian region shop available

### 3. Hong Kong eShop Reality vs API Support

**What Actually Exists:**
- Hong Kong DOES have an official Nintendo eShop (launched April 3, 2018)
- Nintendo eShop Gift Cards for Hong Kong are available for purchase
- Official Nintendo Store website exists for Hong Kong
- Nintendo has physical retail presence in Hong Kong (2024)

**API Limitation:**
- The nintendo-switch-eshop library's `getActiveShops()` and `getShopsAsia()` functions do not return Hong Kong
- This appears to be a limitation of the library's API endpoints or Nintendo's public API structure

### 4. Technical Analysis

**Current Implementation Issues:**
- The system expects Hong Kong to be available but the Nintendo API doesn't provide it
- REGION_METADATA in the code includes many regions that aren't actually returned by `getActiveShops()`
- The code has hardcoded region assumptions that don't match Nintendo's actual API response

**Code Analysis:**
```javascript
// The code assumes HK exists but Nintendo's API doesn't return it
const REGION_METADATA = {
  // ... many regions listed including some not in getActiveShops()
  'HK': { difficult: true, giftCards: true }, // HK is not in the metadata, would need to be added
};
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### This is a Nintendo API Limitation, Not Implementation Issue

1. **Nintendo's Public API Structure**: The `getActiveShops()` function only returns 43 regions, with Asia severely underrepresented (only Japan)

2. **Regional API Segmentation**: Nintendo appears to have different API endpoints or access levels:
   - Public APIs used by the library return limited regions
   - Hong Kong likely uses a separate API endpoint (https://ec.nintendo.com/api/HK/zh/search/sales)
   - Language-specific endpoints (Hong Kong eShop is Chinese-only)

3. **Library Scope**: The nintendo-switch-eshop library focuses on the major regions accessible through Nintendo's main public APIs

## Recommendations

### Short-term Solutions:
1. **Document the limitation** - Clearly state that HK is not supported due to Nintendo API limitations
2. **Add error handling** - Provide clear error messages when users request HK region
3. **Suggest alternatives** - Recommend users to use Japan (JP) region as the closest Asian alternative

### Long-term Solutions:
1. **Direct API Integration**: Implement direct calls to Hong Kong's specific eShop API endpoint
2. **Multi-endpoint Strategy**: Use different API endpoints for different regions
3. **Community Contribution**: Submit a feature request to the nintendo-switch-eshop library maintainers

## Comparison with Expected vs Actual

### Expected (based on Nintendo's physical presence):
- Hong Kong should be available as an Asian region
- Should support price checking for HK region
- Should return HKD pricing

### Actual (based on API testing):
- Hong Kong not in `getActiveShops()` response
- Hong Kong not in `getShopsAsia()` response  
- Only Japan represents Asia in the API
- No HKD pricing available through standard API calls

## Conclusion

The Hong Kong (HK) region isn't supported **due to limitations in Nintendo's public API structure**, not due to implementation issues in the code. While Hong Kong has a fully functional Nintendo eShop with gift card support and physical retail presence, it's not accessible through the standard API endpoints used by the nintendo-switch-eshop library.

This is a **Nintendo API limitation** that affects all applications using the standard Nintendo eShop APIs, not just this implementation.

## Impact on Users

- Users requesting Hong Kong pricing will not receive results
- Alternative: Users can check Japan (JP) pricing as the closest Asian region
- Manual workaround: Users would need to check Hong Kong eShop directly at Nintendo's official website
